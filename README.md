# Yousweeper Troll
A troll (unpacked) chrome extension that messes with your friends by preventing them from watching videos unless they beat a minesweeper game. (Youtube shorts is impossible.) It disguises itself as tetris.

# How to install?
Download the zip here: https://github.com/justamirror/yousweeper-troll/archive/refs/heads/main.zip and unzip it somewhere hidden. Then enable Developer Mode with the Dev Mode Toggle, and load the folder you made by unzipping with load unpacked extension, then enjoy!
